Multi-bit Encryption Lock System Simulator on the FPGA DE1-SoC


The guys down at "SafeCrackersInternational" needed to practice their skills on electronic locks, and they decided to hire me. My job was to simulate the ultra-powerful multi-bit encryption lock that they would be facing in the real world.
This system generates a random passcode, consisting of a 4-digit number in base-4, and the budding safecracker must then guess the code. If they're right they win. If not, they die... well, maybe not. 
These guys aren't the best in the business, so to encourage them I illustrate how close they come to guessing the correct lock by displaying how many digits were correct, and how many digits were misplaced. Additionally, to help grade the "burglars-in-training," I have also provided them with a count of how many attempts they make before they get into trouble.
